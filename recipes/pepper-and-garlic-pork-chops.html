    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork chops, Worcestershire, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag. Marinate chops in the mixture for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Remove pork from the marinade and place into the skillet to brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, basting with marinade during cooking, until no longer pink in the centers, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
